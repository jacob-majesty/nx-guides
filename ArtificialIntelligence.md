AI will not replace developers entirely but will change how they work. Here’s a concise and pragmatic view:  

### **What AI Can Do**  
1. **Automate Repetitive Tasks**: AI tools like GitHub Copilot can handle boilerplate code, suggest solutions, and speed up debugging.  
2. **Enhance Productivity**: AI assists in code reviews, testing, and even generating application prototypes.  

### **What AI Cannot Do (Yet)**  
1. **Creative Problem Solving**: Designing complex systems, understanding business requirements, and innovating solutions require human judgment.  
2. **Contextual Understanding**: AI lacks deep domain expertise and cannot replace developers' ability to tailor solutions to specific needs.  
3. **Ownership and Accountability**: Only humans can be responsible for decisions, ethics, and long-term maintenance.  

### **How Developers Can Stay Relevant**  
1. **Focus on Problem-Solving**: Hone your ability to break down and solve real-world problems.  
2. **Learn AI Tools**: Use AI as an assistant to augment your productivity, not as a competitor.  
3. **Deepen Domain Expertise**: Specialize in areas like system design, architecture, or niche fields where human input is critical.  
4. **Adapt and Upskill**: Stay updated with emerging technologies and trends to remain valuable.  

### **Bottom Line**  
AI won’t replace developers—it will replace *some tasks* developers do. Those who adapt and use AI as a tool will thrive; those who resist may struggle. Focus on creativity, critical thinking, and leveraging AI effectively.
